<h1>Context</h1>
<p>Investment program prediction is a data-driven process that leverages machine learning and data analysis techniques to forecast the types or categories of investment programs that individuals or organizations are likely to select based on various input factors or features.

This predictive modeling approach is valuable for financial institutions,investment firms,and individual investors to make informed decisions and tailor investment offerings to meet the preferences and needs of clients.


Prediction of investment program types typically involves using machine learning techniques to classify investments into different categories based on input features or points. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform investment program prediction in Python using machine learning.</p>
<h3>Input features group description :</h3>
<p>SE1 (Age) , SE2 (Geographic location) - Customer data</p>
<p>BA1 – BA7 – Banking activity , money equivalent for general activities on customer’s bank account in last year , i.e. sum of payments for loan return</p>
<p>PE1 – PE15 – Investing history , flag if customer had one of 15 popular investment products/programs in last year</p>
<p>IA1 – IA3 – Investing activity , counts for different types of operations on investment accounts in last year</p>
